#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

1. SOFTWARE ENGINEERING is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development and maintenance of high-quality software. It involves the use of principles, methods, and tools to design, develop, test, deploy and maintain software products.

2 . Software engineering is important in the technology industry because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1.The development of programming languages .
2.The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
3.The introduction of structured programming in the 1970s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements specification: It involves gathering and documenting the user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing the code and developing the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Verifying that the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Deploying the software to the production environment.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall: Is a sequeintial approach  with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall.
Agile: Takes a iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility ,collaboration and responding to change.

CONTRAST
Structure: Waterfall is rigid and phase-driven while Agile is adaptive and cyclical.
Flexibility: Waterfall resists changes post phase while agile emraces changes throughout the development process.
User Involvement: Waterfall involves customers primarily at the start and the end while Agile requires ongoing collaboration with the user.
Project Timeline: Waterfall offers predictable schedules while Agile timelines are fluid, adapting to evolving needs.

When to use each methodology
Waterfall: When building apps with a stict time frame and budget.
Agile: When building apps like fitness apps where you can get frequent feedback from the users to enhance their experience


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and exexcuting test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software products.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs and VCS enhance productivity ,collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, debugging tools and testing tools in IDEs, and version control in VCS. An example of an IDE is Visual Studio ,while that of VCS is Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Common challenges include:
1. Changing requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle,leading to scope creep and project delays.
2. Tight deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
3. Technical debt: It can impede future development eforts and increase maintenance costs.

STRATEGIES FOR OVERCOMING CHALLENGES.
1. Prioritization of tasks.
2. Regular reassessmentof project goals and timelines.
3. Effective communication
4. Continuous learning and skill development.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing: Verifies individual components or units of code.
Integration testing: Tests how different components interact with each other.
System testing: Verifies the entire system meets the requirements.
Acceptance testing: Verifies the system meets the user's expectations.
Each type of testing is important as it helps identify and fix defects early in the development cycle, reducing the overall cost and time of software development, and leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the practice of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses form AI models.
Prompt engineering is important as it can significantly impact the quality and relevance of the responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: Create an image of a girl eating ice cream.

Clear prompt: create an image of a dark skinned girl wearinga a yellow floral dress, eating vanilla ice cream on a cone on a sunny day. 

The improved prompt is more effecive as it is clearer and provides more details which will make the output align more to the user's needs.
